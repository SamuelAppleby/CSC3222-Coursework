Controls: 
Movement - WASD

Notes:
All collision methods and many aspects of the game are implemented. To test all collisions you can just play the game, each time a collision occurs 
the normal, penetration and type of collision are output.

Spring calculations have been implemented, to test you must buy a ballon from the balloon shop (a coin is required to do this), which then attaches
a balloon to the player.

Robots move with a random force after a given time period.

Food and Coin objects spawn at a random valid tiled position on the map every 5 and 15 seconds respectively.

You can also gain points (using the fibonacci sequence) by visiting the food shop if you have food.

If lives reaches 0 the program exits.

You may have to select the CSC3022 2019 folder as the startup project if the program doesn't initially run.
